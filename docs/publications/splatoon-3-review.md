# "Splatoon 3" Review for "The Clarion" Newspaper

I bought the game "Splatoon 3" for the Nintendo Switch in September 2022, and I had a really good time with it. Before buying, I decided I'd review it for my college's newspaper: [The Clarion](https://www.theonlineclarion.com/). On September 28th, the review was published.

I focused on writing for many people to be able to read, where if a word of 'gamer' vocabulary didn't exlain itself, I chose to use a different word. An example may be that even if 'single-player' is pretty self-explanatory, 'Player VS. Environment' isn't nearly as easily understood.

The review, including a description of the game, my thoughts on it, and what I believe others will think, can be found at [The Clarion's website](https://www.theonlineclarion.com/arts-culture/2022/09/28/splatoon-3-offers-new-content-and-welcome-changes/).
