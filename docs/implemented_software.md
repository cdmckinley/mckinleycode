# This website exists thanks to:
- [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) and GitHub for implementing comments and deployment.
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) for page-generation, styling, and the comments-section template.
