# Bluesky and its AT Protocol
A "billionaire-proof" social network with an open API? Yes please!

### What is Bluesky
Bluesky is a micro-blogging social network,functionally akin to Twitter in many ways. Bluesky aims to use its underlying protocol, AT Protocol, to create a "social internet" where no entity can control the entire network. It also has some cool features, such as user-made algorithms and feeds to read users' posts, and self-verification for those who have their own domain names. And I can't forget the free API and AT Protocol tools, allowing interaction with the network.

### What is AT Protocol
As described on [the AT Protocol website](https://atproto.com/specs/atp): "The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol or atproto) is a generic federated protocol for building open social media applications." It allows for the "social internet" concept, described above and explained more down below. AT Protocol allows interaction with Bluesky's public data, and can interact with a profile if given the right credentials.

#### Developers: Safety first!
If you plan to allow programmatic access to a profile, especially if foreign code is involved, please generate an App Password from the Bluesky website. This can give limited, revokeable access to another application, keeping the profile safer.

### Why I find AT Protocol so fascinating
The short answer is, among other elements, their free API and approach to the idea of a "social internet". But allow me to describe these in more detail:

#### Free API
