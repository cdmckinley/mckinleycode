# Does this site have an issue?
Here's what I ask you to do:

First, see if the issue you've encountered is already listed in [the issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/cdmckinley/mckinleycode/issues).

If so, but you notice some information is missing, please leave a comment on that issue.

If the issue is not listed, please think about what might have caused the problem, and submit a new issue through GitHub. Please include context on how the issue may have occurred, and how it might be re-created on my end. (This helps me understand what caused the issue, which brings me closer to a solution.)
